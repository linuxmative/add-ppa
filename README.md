# add-ppa
Universal script to add a PPA repository to the system without using software-properties-common. Relevant for ubuntu-based systems that lack the software-properties-common package, such as Elementary OS, which lacks some of the standard Ubuntu packages. This script can also be used to add an Ubuntu PPA repository to Debian. 

Attention! Adding Ubuntu PPA repository to Debian may cause dependency conflicts.
